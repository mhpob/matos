list_project_files(
  project = NULL,
  file_type = c("all", "detections", "receiver_metadata", "tag_metadata"),
  since = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{project}{Either the project number (the number in your project page URL)
or the full name of the project (the big name in bold on your project page,
\emph{not} the "Project Title").}

\item{file_type}{one of, or a vector of, "all" (default), "detections",
"receiver_metadata", or "tag_metadata". Partial matching is
allowed.}

\item{since}{Only list files uploaded after this date. Optional, but must be
in YYYY-MM-DD format.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns of "project", "file_type", "upload_date", and "file_name".
}
\description{
This function lists the file names, types, upload date, and URLs of MATOS
project files -- basically everything you see in the \emph{Project Files} section
of your project page. Because it is from your project page, you will be
prompted to log in.
}
\section{Details}{

\code{list_project_files} is a wrapper around a web-scraping routine:
\enumerate{
\item find the project number if not provided, 2) download
the HTML table, 3) parse the URL for each file, and 4) combine the table and
URLs into a data frame. This function is most useful when investigating what
files you have available, and then downloading them with
\code{\link{get_project_file}}.
}

\code{list_project_files} lists tag and receiver metadata files that have been
uploaded by the user. These are the files listed on the \emph{Project Files} section
of your project page.
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
# List files using project number:
list_project_files(87)

# Or using the project name
list_project_files('umces boem offshore wind energy')

# List only the receiver deployment metadata files
List_project_files(87, 'receiver_metadata')

# List both the receiver and transmitter deployment metadata files
List_project_files(87, c('receiver_metadata', 'tag_metadata'))

# Cheat and use shorter names
List_project_files(87, c('receiver', 'tag'))
}
}
