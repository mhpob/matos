This project was then expanded into a larger study area to get into greater specificity, more study elements, and with more tagged animals.</span>

In collaboration with the RI Department of Environmental Management, the Atlantic Shark Institute deployed three receivers in 2019 and now has 15 receivers throughout the RI and adjacent waters. 11 of those receivers surround Block Island, RI, three along the RI coat and one adjacent to Fisher’s Island, NY. \\r\\rThe goal is use this acoustic telemetry data and combine it with video obtained through Baited Remote Underwater Video Systems (BRUVS). We deploy BRUVS several times per month in the study area with the goal of characterizing and quantifying shark assemblages in Rhode Island state waters.</span>

With warming water temperatures spinner sharks have been moving further and further north and now have taken up residency in southern New England/New York waters in summer months. The ASI and partners will be studying all elements of this new addition and what effect it may have on the spinner sharks and other sharks that share these waters.</span>

This study considers the ecological role of large-bodied, low-tropic level marine species (i.e., basking shark, Cetorhinus maximus; ocean sunfish, Mola mola) and potential risks to the species from offshore wind (OSW) energy development. Data are gathered using a variety of technologies (acoustic tags, camera tags) and acoustic receivers are deployed by commercial fishing partners around the island of Martha's Vineyard, MA.</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 7          The mid-Atlantic continental shelf has been identified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory as the coastal region with the greatest offshore wind resource potential in waters less than 60 m deep and therefore is very well suited for near-term offshore wind energy technology. Federally endangered Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus) and the commercially important Winter Skate (Leucoraja ocellata), are two species that occur in the Delaware Wind Energy Area (WEA), although there is little information on their patterns of residency and habitat. Acoustic receivers were deployed around the perimeter of the DE WEA in February 2017 to monitor the seasonal occupancy and movement of telemetered individuals. In April 2017, VEMCO acoustic transmitters were implanted in 50 Atlantic Sturgeon, and 50 Winter Skate in the Delaware coastal ocean. In addition, the receivers record the presence of species tagged with compatible transmitters identified through the ACT network.</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 8              Sandbridge Shoal is a borrow area off of Virginia that is used by multiple stakeholders to rebuild beaches. This area has also been identified as an Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) for many species, including 8 sharks characterized as Highly Migratory Species (HMS). As information about the use of the borrow area by migratory sharks is scarce, and dredging activities are expected to continue during the next few years, research efforts to improve the comprehension of the ecology of these large predators will increase our understanding of the potential effects of dredging and contribute to the eventual implementation of adapted mitigation measures. Similar research is also conducted in a similar shoal (Hens and Chickens Shoal in Delaware) where dredging activities are not conducted. A total of 15 VR2AR VEMCO receivers have been deployed to cover Sandridge Shoal and at least 25 acoustic transmitters are aimed to be deployed on individuals of various shark species in 2022 and 2023.</span>

Evidence of predation in the form of shark bites on seals hauled out on the Rock has provided some insight into the presence of white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) and mako sharks (Isurus oxyrinchus) but much remains to be studied on the population dynamics and behaviors of sharks in the area. This project aims to document the presence and absence of tagged sharks in the waters surrounding Mount Desert Rock as well as shifts in populations in response to changing environmental factors.

<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 22            Southern flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma) is an economically important species throughout its range, but it is overfished in North Carolina and the southeastern USA.  Offshore spawning grounds have not been identified for southern flounder populations in any state. Our objectives are to: (1) Determine the timing of offshore migration by acoustically tagging southern flounder in North Carolina and monitoring when they pass through acoustic gates spanning all inlets in Pamlico Sound; (2) Track offshore migrations of tagged flounder and locate possible spawning grounds by using an offshore acoustic curtain and an autonomous vehicle (wave glider with telemetry receiver); (3) Conduct ichthyoplankton surveys at potential spawning sites and use DNA barcoding to determine if southern flounder eggs are found; (4) Determine sex and maturity of adults sampled offshore; (5) Back calculate the location of potential spawning habitats of southern flounder by aging larval flounder caught.</span>

ECO-PAM aims to advance research for detection of N. Atl. right whale, to better understand their presence, distribution, and seasonality, and to contribute to characterization of their habitat in offshore wind lease areas. ECO-PAM will be focused on the Ørsted Ocean Wind lease area off of NJ but will also include sampling in Ørsted lease areas around MA. The project will include two acoustic monitoring buoys deployed by WHOI, an acoustic vector sensor buoy developed by URI, and an autonomous underwater glider deployed by RU. Results will be used to inform and mitigate impacts during construction and operation of offshore wind facilities. In addition to the passive acoustics used to detect whales, gliders will be equipped with VEMCO receivers to detect tagged fish along the glider trajectory.</span>

Recreational mariners sailing on extensive cruises along a variety of national coastal waterways, were assigned to carry VEMCO VR2W receivers and asked to deploy the receivers from their boats each time they docked or anchored. The study aimed to determine if this method had the potential to record tagged fish and fill gaps in stationary receiver array coverage. Results indicated that these deployments were not only effective in detecting tagged fish and complementing stationary receiver arrays, but may also function as a method for determining positioning of future stationary receiver arrays.</span>

Between these estimates, the population increased quickly, far exceeding ESA recovery criteria.  All three estimates were calculated from traditional mark/recapture study designs which require a large amount of effort, are costly, are often biased and have large error associated due to the violation of assumptions. The goal of the study is to integrate high resolution side-scan sonar, acoustic telemetry, and targeted sampling of adults to develop multi-year quantitative population estimates for shortnose sturgeon in the Hudson River. The abundance estimates will be used to help set and track recovery objectives and criteria, a top priority identified by the National Marine Fisheries Service.</span>

<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 30  Using a multifaceted approach, the purpose of this study is to improve the understanding of spatial and temporal habitat use by winter flounder in the Boston Harbor estuary and the adjacent waters of Massachusetts Bay. Data on habitat utilization will enhance the ability to protect critical life stages while giving resource managers the ability to be more specific in time of year (TOY) recommendations. One component of the study will be to determine the time and location of spawning through the tracking of gravid adults using acoustic telemetry. Fish will be caught inside Boston Harbor using bottom trawl and rod and reel equipment, then externally tagged with V13-1H transmitter. Forty acoustic receivers will be strategically placed inside the Boston Harbor estuary to create a fine-scale array to track movements. A pre-existing array of over 100 receivers that are spread out around the Massachusetts coast will complement the Boston Harbor array and detect tagged winter flounder movement</span>

This array will likely expand its scope in the future, adding 7 additional moorings in 2023, as Maine seeks to better understand a) the distribution of baleen whales within the Gulf of Maine and b) baseline ambient noise levels prior to offshore wind development. \\r\\rThe spatial coverage of this array may also serve as a bountiful platform of opportunity for tagging studies not only within the Department, but the region. Maine is happy to engage in these data-sharing efforts for the benefit of knowledge beyond its immediate purposes.</span>

The study will provide information regarding spawning adult river herring using the Mystic River system, which will provide insight for MA Division of Marine Resources with regard to management of spawning river herring populations in the Mystic River system. This is a pilot study to identify specific locations for focusing future river herring monitoring efforts in this system. Thirty-two river herring were tagged with VEMCO V7 acoustic transmitters, and 23 VEMCO VR2W, 69 kHz receivers were deployed throughout the Mystic River and Lakes system</span>

The southern region of the Potomac River where the sanctuary is located has a diversity of both native and non-native fish species, such as bass, catfish, crappie, sunfish, perch, striped bass, blue catfish, and snakehead. The "Ghost Fleet" of over 100 sunken shipwrecks at Mallows Bay provides a unique habitat structure for both terrestrial and aquatic species, and is hypothesized to play an important role in providing fish habitat. The Smithsonian Environmental Research Center contributes an acoustic receiver maintained by Maryland DNR to monitor species that visit the sanctuary. The data collected from this receiver will help NOAA MPNMS staff and partners better understand what species are present in the sanctuary, including the presence of any rare, endangered, or threatened species.</span>

American shad were captured in the Albemarle Sound, tagged with sonic transmitters, and their spawning migrations were tracked using an array of acoustic receivers. Of the 62 fish which made detectable migrations during the six years of the study, 55 ascended the Chowan River while only five ascended the Roanoke River. These results indicate the Albemarle Sound stock of American shad prefer the spawning grounds in the Chowan and its tributaries, the Blackwater, Nottoway, and Meherrin rivers over those in the Roanoke River.

Currently, NCDMF tags striped bass, red drum, southern flounder, spotted seatrout, and cobia in all coastal waters of the state. The use of conventional tags is the primary methodology for this project with an associated public-facing tag-return program. In addition, acoustic telemetry tagging studies are also conducted through this program. This project contains only tagging data for the species listed in this study.

This highly migratory species has low fecundity, producing an average of 4-25 pups per litter, slow growth, and late sexual maturity. Due to its low rebound potential and current estimated stock status, this species is listed as endangered according to the IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature) Red List. Although a recent moratorium has been instituted for 2022 and 2023 within the North Atlantic, this species is still targeted and captured as bycatch in various recreational and commercial fisheries in regions where the species remains unprotected. \\r\\rRecently, we identified an inshore site within the waters of Montauk, NY that has a high density of YOY shortfin mako sharks. We aim to acoustically and satellite tag these YOY sharks to identify various ecological and biological characteristics of this endangered species.</span>

Pamlico Sound, North Carolina hosts a significant but relatively understudied population of Cownose Rays, and juvenile Bull Shark numbers have been increasing in the estuary in association with rising water temperatures. In this project, acoustic telemetry is used to identify movement behavior and key habitat areas within the estuary for both species, and to determine whether these species interact and influence each other's habitat use patterns.</span>

As top predators and larger fish, these species have also been long sought after by recreational fishers throughout the eastern United States, including Rhode Island. These and other species have supported pastimes of recreational fishing amongst avid anglers for leisure, as well as support party and charter businesses and shark diving tours during certain times of the year. This work aims to improve our understanding of these species movement and occupancy within certain areas of Southern New England, including Rhode Island state waters.</span>

A vistor to these borrows is the Shortnose sturgeon, a species of North American sturgeon listed under the Endangered Species Act in 2012. Limited information shows that Atlantic sturgeon occupy offshore waters (marine zone) up to at least 40m in depth during the winter. However, there is little data regarding their seasonal patterns of distribution and abundance in and around these borrows. This project aims to assess sturgeon habitat associated with borrow areas by creating a baseline data set pre and post dredging activity through the use of acoustic telemetry.</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 93                      In order to evaluate the utilization of ARs as foraging grounds and promote management policies, it is necessary to first understand when these fish move to the ARs (age or season) how often the ARs are frequented by this species, how long they spend on these structures and whether they repeatedly move into and out of the estuaries or move between offshore ARs. To quantify movement within and between the ARs receivers will be placed within Fire Island, Moriches, Shinnecock, Kismet and Yellowbar ARs. These receivers will determine the presence, movement between the receivers and movement between the five AR regions. To assess the connectivity between the south shore estuaries to the ARs, this project will take advantage of the significant acoustic infrastructure previously and currently being deployed by other NYDEC projects. For this project, 60 black sea bass and blackfish will be caught either in the estuaries or the associated ARs via fish traps or hook and line.</span>

This project is intended for tracking seasonal movements, habitat usage, trends in northern movement of southern species and the seasonal patterns in the diversity of finfish and sharks in the region. A total of 49 receivers are maintained annually along the south shore of Long Island. The acoustic network has been funded by various sources including NOAA and is presently funded by the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC).</span>

Because effective management of these species requires an understanding of marine movements and habitat use, the identification of the temporal and spatial trends in the NYLA will provide important baseline information regarding habitat use and environmental preferences in offshore marine waters.</span>

While offshore renewable energy development poses potential environmental impacts that are not fully understood, one potential source of impact, common to all offshore renewable energy technologies, comes from this transmission of power to shore. Undersea power transmission export cables generate electromagnetic fields (EMFs) that may impact marine organisms. This project uses acoustic telemetry arrays to evaluate effects of EMFs on behavior and movement pre-, during, and post-construction using movement metrics such as acceleration, depth, 2-d and 3-d position, and residency on local species.</span>

Tidal stream transport (Forward et al. 2003), intra-estuarine dynamics (Reyns et al. 2007), intercoastal boundary layers (Nickols et al. 2015), riverine barriers (Jones et al. 2015), and hypoxia (Bell et al. 2003) can all alter the dispersal potential of a crab. However, movements within an estuary, while important, have received previous investigation by others and we posit that non-local dispersal shapes the genetic make-up of the crab.</span>

<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 129     Baseline information is needed on the extent of fish migration corridors within BOEM-leased Wind Energy Areas. This two-year biotelemetry study deployed a beforeafter-gradient approach to evaluate migration behavior and habitat selection of two model migratory fishes, Atlantic sturgeon Acipenser oxyrhynchus and striped bass Morone saxatilis, in the Maryland Wind Energy Area (MD WEA). The MD WEA is located in the migration corridors for both species during periods of spring, fall and winter. Detected individuals within the MD WEA originated broadly, from Maine to South Carolina. During summer, Atlantic sturgeon were rarely detected and striped bass were absent in the MD WEA, suggesting a potential window for wind turbine construction. Dynamic habitat models identified cross-shelf gradients in depth and temperature that were predictive of seasonal incidence and whether test species distributions were within MD WEA or in adjacent shelf regions.  https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.6hdr7sqx3</span>

This study builds upon past Hudson River Foundation-supported research, which suggested that striped bass migration patterns, categorized as “contingent structure,” might be a useful organizing concept in understanding how striped bass seasonally utilize the Hudson River Estuary. Seasonal migrations of three contingents (river, harbor, and ocean contingents) were investigated using both manual tracking (three seasonal campaigns) and remote data-logging receiver arrays over a 18-month period (May 2010-December 2011).</span>

<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 134                      Hudson River striped bass show highly variable migration patterns, as seen through tagging studies and otolith microchemical analyses (Clark 1968; Secor 1999). Recent studies have shown resident, estuarine, and ocean migratory contingents in the Hudson River (Secor et al. 2001). These contingent behaviors play a dominant role in the exposure of these fish to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (Secor and Zlokovitz 1999). We describe a study of seasonal migrations of contaminated resident striped bass to better understand the likelihood of angler consumption of these fish. We investigated the resident contingent of Hudson River striped bass, focusing on the seasonal patterns of migration by these fish. Seasonal migrations of resident fish were measured using both manual tracking (four seasonal campaigns) and remote data-logging receiver arrays (three intercept sites) over a 12-month period (October 2004-November 2005).\\r\\rResults published in Wingate and Secor, 2007.</span>

Here, we propose to better understand the constraints on resident Chesapeake Bay striped bass production under continued and perhaps worsening conditions of thermal and hypoxic stress. A widely held, but unsubstantiated view of Chesapeake Bay striped bass is that eutrophication and related increased incidence of hypoxia during summer has reduced growth and condition, and occasionally resulted in fish kills. In this study, we will directly evaluate Coutant’s thermal niche-oxygen squeeze hypothesis in the Patuxent River estuary. We develop bioenergetic benchmarks of resident striped bass growth as habitat indicators relevant to management of striped bass and other living resources.</span>

A central issue in the management of Hudson River striped bass is how this population contributes to coastal fisheries. What factors influence coastal migrations? This study used existing telemetry receiver assets in the Hudson River, shelf waters, and other major Atlantic estuaries to examine the influence of sex, size, and spawning reach on these coastal migrations.</span>

The goal of this study is to determine the seasonal movement and habitat use of Striped Bass and Atlantic Sturgeon in the Saco River. Using acoustic telemetry, this study  established a network of passive receivers to better understand Striped Bass seasonal movements in the Saco River, and throughout their coastal migratory range. The Gulf of Maine Distinct Population Segment of Atlantic Sturgeon are listed as threatened. Atlantic Sturgeon utilize the Saco River as a feeding ground, but move among nearby rivers. Characterizing seasonal presence and connectivity of Atlantic Sturgeon among Maine Rivers, is essential to better understand dynamics of threatened populations. Fish are internally tagged with V13 or V16 acoustic tag. Receivers are located throughout the Saco River and Saco Bay and deployed from June to November.</span>

This has led to increasing abundance and spatial distribution of Blue Catfish within the James River watershed and has prompted concern over the impacts of Blue Catfish on native species. The James River supports an active recreational fishery and a commercial low-frequency electrofishing fishery, with the commercial zone limited to a 100-rkm section of the tidal mainstem. The purpose of this project is to identify movement and distribution patterns and assess Blue Catfish response to LFEF in an effort to inform guidance, management decisions, and angler outreach.</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 147                                 Bowfin, Amia calva, is an evolutionarily and ecologically important species native to much of eastern North America. It is a large bodied (to 700+ mm TL) generalist apex predator in many river systems. Relatively little is known about the spatial ecology of Bowfin, with only a single study published using acoustic telemetry to determine habitat use  (from Lake Ontario; Midwood et al. 2018). Northern Snakehead, native to eastern Asia, is an established, invasive species in tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and Virginia. It is morphologically and ecologically similar to Bowfin. Beyond its occurrence in the tributaries, little is known of aspects of its ecology in these rivers. This study will employ acoustic telemetry to fill in these data gaps so that habitat use, movement patterns, temperature selectivity, and environmental responses of bowfin and snakehead can be assessed and compared in a tidal freshwater habitat in the mid-Atlantic region.</span>

Management of speckled trout has also been marred by cold-stun events which can kill a significant portion of the stock and have detrimental localized effects. Virginia is the northern extent of speckled trout populations and is the most likely portion of its range to experience cold-stun events. The primary objective of this project was to use acoustic telemetry fitted with internal temperature loggers to better understand how speckled trout react to declining water temperatures and begin to assess what proportion of the population is subject to cold stun events.</span>

A second goal was to monitor and maintain acoustic receiver array in the York and Rappahannock river systems. Both of these goals relate directly to two project objectives: Assess Critical Nursery Habitats and Assess Degree of Dependence of James River and York Atlantic Sturgeon on Chesapeake Bay Habitats. \\r\\rMaintenance of 2 receivers has continued, but the major array has been pulled since 2020.</span>

The initial goal of this project is to acoustically tag and monitor adult cobia and striped bass, with the potential to move into more data-poor species, such as red and black drum. This project was made possible by a grant from the Office of the Virginia Secretary of Natural and Historic Resources and was initiated as a complement to the work being done to maintain an acoustic array backbone throughout the Chesapeake Bay alongside the NOAA Chesapeake Bay Office, Maryland Department of Natural Resources, University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, and the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center.</span>
