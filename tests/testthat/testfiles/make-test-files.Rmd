## html_file_list_nofiles.RDS

File was created by running:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
html_file_list <- get_file_list(240, 'dataextractionfiles')
saveRDS(html_file_list,
        testthat::test_path('testfiles/html_file_list_nofiles.RDS'))
```

At the time, project #240 ("UMCES TailWinds") had not been matched with the OTN data base and so had no matched detections.
