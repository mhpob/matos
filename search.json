This project was then expanded into a larger study area to get into greater specificity, more study elements, and with more tagged animals. #> 3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Acoustic receivers had never been deployed in Rhode Island waters until 2019. In collaboration with the RI Department of Environmental Management, the Atlantic Shark Institute deployed three receivers in 2019 and now has 15 receivers throughout the RI and adjacent waters. 11 of those receivers surround Block Island, RI, three along the RI coat and one adjacent to Fisher’s Island, NY. \\\\r\\\\rThe goal is use this acoustic telemetry data and combine it with video obtained through Baited Remote Underwater Video Systems (BRUVS).

With warming water temperatures spinner sharks have been moving further and further north and now have taken up residency in southern New England/New York waters in summer months. The ASI and partners will be studying all elements of this new addition and what effect it may have on the spinner sharks and other sharks that share these waters. #> 5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               This project #> 6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Rapid growth of the wind energy industry on the US OCS has increased vessel traffic in offshore waters. This study considers the ecological role of large-bodied, low-tropic level marine species (i.e., basking shark, Cetorhinus maximus; ocean sunfish, Mola mola) and potential risks to the species from offshore wind (OSW) energy development. Data are gathered using a variety of technologies (acoustic tags, camera tags) and acoustic receivers are deployed by commercial fishing partners around the island of Martha's Vineyard, MA. #> 7          The mid-Atlantic continental shelf has been identified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory as the coastal region with the greatest offshore wind resource potential in waters less than 60 m deep and therefore is very well suited for near-term offshore wind energy technology. Federally endangered Atlantic Sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus) and the commercially important Winter Skate (Leucoraja ocellata), are two species that occur in the Delaware Wind Energy Area (WEA), although there is little information on their patterns of residency and habitat. Acoustic receivers were deployed around the perimeter of the DE WEA in February 2017 to monitor the seasonal occupancy and movement of telemetered individuals. In April 2017, VEMCO acoustic transmitters were implanted in 50 Atlantic Sturgeon, and 50 Winter Skate in the Delaware coastal ocean. In addition, the receivers record the presence of species tagged with compatible transmitters identified through the ACT network. #> 8              Sandbridge Shoal is a borrow area off of Virginia that is used by multiple stakeholders to rebuild beaches. This area has also been identified as an Essential Fish Habitat (EFH) for many species, including 8 sharks characterized as Highly Migratory Species (HMS). As information about the use of the borrow area by migratory sharks is scarce, and dredging activities are expected to continue during the next few years, research efforts to improve the comprehension of the ecology of these large predators will increase our understanding of the potential effects of dredging and contribute to the eventual implementation of adapted mitigation measures. Similar research is also conducted in a similar shoal (Hens and Chickens Shoal in Delaware) where dredging activities are not conducted. A total of 15 VR2AR VEMCO receivers have been deployed to cover Sandridge Shoal and at least 25 acoustic transmitters are aimed to be deployed on individuals of various shark species in 2022 and 2023. #> 9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <NA> #> 10                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Tagging adult American Shad in Brandywine Creek, White Clay Creek, Red Clay Creek to examine site fidelity in a small tributary of the Delaware River, as well as phenology. #> 11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   One VR2W receiver has been placed at CFCC's dock to monitor tagged organisms in the Cape Fear River.

Evidence of predation in the form of shark bites on seals hauled out on the Rock has provided some insight into the presence of white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) and mako sharks (Isurus oxyrinchus) but much remains to be studied on the population dynamics and behaviors of sharks in the area. This project aims to document the presence and absence of tagged sharks in the waters surrounding Mount Desert Rock as well as shifts in populations in response to changing environmental factors. In collaboration with the College of the Atlantic and Allied Whale, one VEMCO VR2W acoustic receiver was deployed in the waters near Mount Desert Rock. #> 14                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <NA> #> 15                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Research efforts to locate Atlantic Sturgeon in Connecticut waters and determine preferred habitats and high use areas within the Connecticut River and in Long Island Sound.

However, to make these restrictions most effective, knowledge of a sea turtle’s habitat preference, site fidelity, and spatial and temporal use of that habitat needs to be determined.  Acoustic telemetry is a useful means of acquiring such data. #> 20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The DE Division of Fish and Wildlife maintains an array of Vemco receivers in the Delaware Estuary.

They were captured, tagged, and released within an oyster culture farm. The goal is to determine residency time of this model species around an oyster farm, and to determine how fish might use the surrounding habitats. A 9-receiver VPS array was used for fine scale tracking around the lease, and additional receivers were placed in strategic areas around the bay to determine larger scale movements. #> 22            Southern flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma) is an economically important species throughout its range, but it is overfished in North Carolina and the southeastern USA.

Our objectives are to: (1) Determine the timing of offshore migration by acoustically tagging southern flounder in North Carolina and monitoring when they pass through acoustic gates spanning all inlets in Pamlico Sound; (2) Track offshore migrations of tagged flounder and locate possible spawning grounds by using an offshore acoustic curtain and an autonomous vehicle (wave glider with telemetry receiver); (3) Conduct ichthyoplankton surveys at potential spawning sites and use DNA barcoding to determine if southern flounder eggs are found; (4) Determine sex and maturity of adults sampled offshore; (5) Back calculate the location of potential spawning habitats of southern flounder by aging larval flounder caught. #> 23                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <NA> #> 24                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <NA> #> 25               The Ørsted Ecosystem and Passive Acoustic Monitoring (ECO-PAM) project is a partnership between Ørsted North America, Rutgers U., Woods Hole Oceanographic, and the U. of Rhode Island. ECO-PAM aims to advance research for detection of N. Atl. right whale, to better understand their presence, distribution, and seasonality, and to contribute to characterization of their habitat in offshore wind lease areas. ECO-PAM will be focused on the Ørsted Ocean Wind lease area off of NJ but will also include sampling in Ørsted lease areas around MA. The project will include two acoustic monitoring buoys deployed by WHOI, an acoustic vector sensor buoy developed by URI, and an autonomous underwater glider deployed by RU. Results will be used to inform and mitigate impacts during construction and operation of offshore wind facilities. In addition to the passive acoustics used to detect whales, gliders will be equipped with VEMCO receivers to detect tagged fish along the glider trajectory. #> 26                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           This study was initiated to test the viability of working with citizen scientists to collect acoustic telemetry data.  Recreational mariners sailing on extensive cruises along a variety of national coastal waterways, were assigned to carry VEMCO VR2W receivers and asked to deploy the receivers from their boats each time they docked or anchored. The study aimed to determine if this method had the potential to record tagged fish and fill gaps in stationary receiver array coverage. Results indicated that these deployments were not only effective in detecting tagged fish and complementing stationary receiver arrays, but may also function as a method for determining positioning of future stationary receiver arrays. #> 27                                                                                                                     The Hudson River presumably supports the largest population shortnose sturgeon as observed throughout its range based on three population estimates conducted in the 1970's and 1990's.  Between these estimates, the population increased quickly, far exceeding ESA recovery criteria.  All three estimates were calculated from traditional mark/recapture study designs which require a large amount of effort, are costly, are often biased and have large error associated due to the violation of assumptions. The goal of the study is to integrate high resolution side-scan sonar, acoustic telemetry, and targeted sampling of adults to develop multi-year quantitative population estimates for shortnose sturgeon in the Hudson River. The abundance estimates will be used to help set and track recovery objectives and criteria, a top priority identified by the National Marine Fisheries Service. #> 28                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        NY maintains a river wide array of receivers annually from NY Harbor to the Federal Dam at Troy.

We seek to examine the movements and behavior of this overwintering population in relation to the presence and abundance of spawning river herring populations, a culturally important indigenous fishery. #> 35                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               This project aims to study the distribution and habitat use of highly migratory species and large pelagics in relation to proposed offshore wind areas in the Gulf of Maine #> 36                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Maine Department of Marine Resources, in cooperation with MADMF, AWSC, James Sulikowski (ASU), John Mohan (UNE), and additional collaborators are working to monitor white shark populations in and around coastal and near-shore state waters. #> 37                                                                                                                                                                                 This passive acoustic monitoring project constitutes 10 subsurface moorings that include acoustic sound traps (ST600STDs) coupled with Innovasea VR2AR acoustic releases for the primary purpose of detecting North Atlantic right whales and other baleen whales within the Gulf of Maine. This array will likely expand its scope in the future, adding 7 additional moorings in 2023, as Maine seeks to better understand a) the distribution of baleen whales within the Gulf of Maine and b) baseline ambient noise levels prior to offshore wind development. \\\\r\\\\rThe spatial coverage of this array may also serve as a bountiful platform of opportunity for tagging studies not only within the Department, but the region. Maine is happy to engage in these data-sharing efforts for the benefit of knowledge beyond its immediate purposes. #> 38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The goal and objectives of the study are to assess movement of adult river herring from Horn Pond to the Earhart Locks. The study will provide information regarding spawning adult river herring using the Mystic River system, which will provide insight for MA Division of Marine Resources with regard to management of spawning river herring populations in the Mystic River system. This is a pilot study to identify specific locations for focusing future river herring monitoring efforts in this system. Thirty-two river herring were tagged with VEMCO V7 acoustic transmitters, and 23 VEMCO VR2W, 69 kHz receivers were deployed throughout the Mystic River and Lakes system #> 39                                                          The Mallows Bay-Potomac River National Marine Sanctuary (MPNMS) is an 18-square mile sanctuary located in the Potomac River of the Chesapeake Bay. The southern region of the Potomac River where the sanctuary is located has a diversity of both native and non-native fish species, such as bass, catfish, crappie, sunfish, perch, striped bass, blue catfish, and snakehead. The \"Ghost Fleet\" of over 100 sunken shipwrecks at Mallows Bay provides a unique habitat structure for both terrestrial and aquatic species, and is hypothesized to play an important role in providing fish habitat. The Smithsonian Environmental Research Center contributes an acoustic receiver maintained by Maryland DNR to monitor species that visit the sanctuary. The data collected from this receiver will help NOAA MPNMS staff and partners better understand what species are present in the sanctuary, including the presence of any rare, endangered, or threatened species. #> 40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Recovery planning for Atlantic sturgeon requires estimates of population abundances against which to evaluate takes and develop feasible restoration targets.

artificial/restored marsh cells in the Paul S. Sarbanes Ecosystem Restoration Project at Poplar Island using acoustic telemetry.  Our main objective is to track fish usage of the restored habitat at Poplar Island and compare it with their usage of the natural habitat in Back Creek. We have partnered with the NOAA National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) to leverage their expertise in fish telemetry. We aim to tag ~80 fish and place 15 receivers in the reference site. We are tagging a diversity of species >21 cm TL, including striped bass, white perch, gizzard shad, and American eels. #> 48                                 CBIBS acts as an acoustic monitoring array for tagged marine species in the Chesapeake Bay. The detection data from up to ten different stations is annually uploaded to this project and our deployment spreadsheet is updated concurrently. Our stations are unique in that they are simultaneously acquiring atmospheric, water quality and physical observations of the marine environment. The corresponding environmental data is archived and available to relate to detection data at https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/OAS/prd/accession/details/159578\\\\r\\\\rOur receiver array hosts either NOAA NCBO or SERC Vemco VR2W or VR2C receivers. Please reach out and share how detection data picked up from the CBIBS array has helped you better understand marine species activity and migration. Through your feedback and additional data requests we can best observe, communicate and support the research needed to monitor the activity of marine species including ASFMC managed species. #> 49                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                This project maintains a line of receivers in the Choptank River at the Chesapeake Bay.

In collaboration with USACE, and NOAA's Chesapeake Bay office, NOAA's National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) is tagging a variety of species including: striped bass, white perch, gizzard shad, American eels, snakehead, diamondback terrapins, and blue crabs. Over 200 fish will be tagged with V8's during this 2 year study. Over 70 receivers will be deployed throughout the marsh cells of Poplar Island, including at the entrances to each cell. This study will demonstrate which aspects of the restored habitats, such as creek size and culvert type, are most used. #> 54                                                                                           This project details acoustic telemetry receivers deployed in the Albemarle Sound Management Area and major inlets throughout the Outer Banks of North Carolina. This array is maintained by the North Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries and expands north from the Roanoke River near the NC/VA border, south to Ocracoke Inlet. The array also includes major rivers connected to the Albemarle Sound, including the Chowan, Perquimans, Pasquotank, North, Scuppernong, and Alligator. Other major waterbodies include Currituck, Croatan, and Roanoke sounds, along with Oregon and Hatteras inlets. \\\\r\\\\rAcoustic telemetry receivers were first deployed in February of 2011 for a project researching Atlantic and shortnose sturgeon migration.

American shad were captured in the Albemarle Sound, tagged with sonic transmitters, and their spawning migrations were tracked using an array of acoustic receivers. Of the 62 fish which made detectable migrations during the six years of the study, 55 ascended the Chowan River while only five ascended the Roanoke River. These results indicate the Albemarle Sound stock of American shad prefer the spawning grounds in the Chowan and its tributaries, the Blackwater, Nottoway, and Meherrin rivers over those in the Roanoke River.

Thus, all detections were of opportunity and hopefully will contribute valuable information to other researchers. #> 73                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         This project uses Slocum glider deployments to perform seasonal surveys of environmental and biological features in the coastal shelf waters of New Jersey as part of the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection's research and monitoring efforts to support offshore wind development.

This highly migratory species has low fecundity, producing an average of 4-25 pups per litter, slow growth, and late sexual maturity. Due to its low rebound potential and current estimated stock status, this species is listed as endangered according to the IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature) Red List. Although a recent moratorium has been instituted for 2022 and 2023 within the North Atlantic, this species is still targeted and captured as bycatch in various recreational and commercial fisheries in regions where the species remains unprotected. \\\\r\\\\rRecently, we identified an inshore site within the waters of Montauk, NY that has a high density of YOY shortfin mako sharks. We aim to acoustically and satellite tag these YOY sharks to identify various ecological and biological characteristics of this endangered species. #> 81                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Cownose Rays and juvenile Bull Sharks often occupy similar estuarine habitats despite the rays being potential prey of the sharks. Pamlico Sound, North Carolina hosts a significant but relatively understudied population of Cownose Rays, and juvenile Bull Shark numbers have been increasing in the estuary in association with rising water temperatures. In this project, acoustic telemetry is used to identify movement behavior and key habitat areas within the estuary for both species, and to determine whether these species interact and influence each other's habitat use patterns. #> 82                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <NA> #> 83                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      This collaborative monitoring project will implement and maintain an acoustic telemetry array in Rhode Island state waters to understand marine species residing in or transiting Rhode Island state waters.

As top predators and larger fish, these species have also been long sought after by recreational fishers throughout the eastern United States, including Rhode Island. These and other species have supported pastimes of recreational fishing amongst avid anglers for leisure, as well as support party and charter businesses and shark diving tours during certain times of the year. This work aims to improve our understanding of these species movement and occupancy within certain areas of Southern New England, including Rhode Island state waters. #> 86                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               RPS Group is an international, scientific technical consultancy that employs more than 5000 people and trades in the United States and elsewhere.

A vistor to these borrows is the Shortnose sturgeon, a species of North American sturgeon listed under the Endangered Species Act in 2012. Limited information shows that Atlantic sturgeon occupy offshore waters (marine zone) up to at least 40m in depth during the winter. However, there is little data regarding their seasonal patterns of distribution and abundance in and around these borrows. This project aims to assess sturgeon habitat associated with borrow areas by creating a baseline data set pre and post dredging activity through the use of acoustic telemetry. #> 93                      In order to evaluate the utilization of ARs as foraging grounds and promote management policies, it is necessary to first understand when these fish move to the ARs (age or season) how often the ARs are frequented by this species, how long they spend on these structures and whether they repeatedly move into and out of the estuaries or move between offshore ARs. To quantify movement within and between the ARs receivers will be placed within Fire Island, Moriches, Shinnecock, Kismet and Yellowbar ARs. These receivers will determine the presence, movement between the receivers and movement between the five AR regions. To assess the connectivity between the south shore estuaries to the ARs, this project will take advantage of the significant acoustic infrastructure previously and currently being deployed by other NYDEC projects. For this project, 60 black sea bass and blackfish will be caught either in the estuaries or the associated ARs via fish traps or hook and line. #> 94                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Researchers at Stony Brook University’s School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences have maintained an acoustic receiver array network in the New York Bight for the last decade. This project is intended for tracking seasonal movements, habitat usage, trends in northern movement of southern species and the seasonal patterns in the diversity of finfish and sharks in the region. A total of 49 receivers are maintained annually along the south shore of Long Island. The acoustic network has been funded by various sources including NOAA and is presently funded by the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC). #> 95                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      <NA> #> 96                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             This was a cooperative project between between Stony Brook University and Equinor Wind US LLC with the goal of deploying acoustic receivers during the site assessment phase of pre-construction in the Empire Wind New York Lease Area (NYLA; Lease OCS-A 0512).

Because effective management of these species requires an understanding of marine movements and habitat use, the identification of the temporal and spatial trends in the NYLA will provide important baseline information regarding habitat use and environmental preferences in offshore marine waters. #> 102                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Projected evaluated the movements, residency, and habitat of Atlantic Sturgeon along the coast of NY and NJ #> 103                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The Ørsted South Fork Wind Farm (ØSFWF) is an offshore wind project in development 35 miles east of Montauk Point and is expected to be New York State’s first operational offshore wind farm. While offshore renewable energy development poses potential environmental impacts that are not fully understood, one potential source of impact, common to all offshore renewable energy technologies, comes from this transmission of power to shore. Undersea power transmission export cables generate electromagnetic fields (EMFs) that may impact marine organisms. This project uses acoustic telemetry arrays to evaluate effects of EMFs on behavior and movement pre-, during, and post-construction using movement metrics such as acceleration, depth, 2-d and 3-d position, and residency on local species. #> 104                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The Smithsonian Environmental Research Center is engaged in acoustic telemetry projects on a variety of coastal and estuarine species through the Smithsonian Movement of Life Initiative.

Array deployments target waterways local to our site in Edgewater, Maryland and also fill gaps between major receiver arrays along the US Atlantic coast. #> 105                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The Fisheries Conservation at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center is tracking the annual migration of Alewife in the Chesapeake Bay. Our previous studies on river herring (Alewife and Blueback Herring) have investigated spawning run counts, spawning habitat use, population genetics, eDNA, temperature regimes and movement/survival (via PIT tagging). In 2022, 50 alewife were tagged in the Choptank River, MD to look at their movements within the tributary during the spawning season, migration timing, and habitat use in the ocean. #> 106                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   This study seeks to identify patterns of Horseshoe Crab habitat use in Chesapeake Bay. #> 107                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   This study seeks to identify patterns in habitat use of Atlantic Stingray along the US Atlantic Coast. #> 108                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      This study seeks to identify patterns in habitat use of Blacktip Shark along the US Atlantic Coast. #> 109                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  This project uses acoustic telemetry to understand the habitat use patterns of invasive blue catfish in Chesapeake Bay in combination with diet information to understand impacts on food webs.

Tidal stream transport (Forward et al. 2003), intra-estuarine dynamics (Reyns et al. 2007), intercoastal boundary layers (Nickols et al. 2015), riverine barriers (Jones et al. 2015), and hypoxia (Bell et al. 2003) can all alter the dispersal potential of a crab. However, movements within an estuary, while important, have received previous investigation by others and we posit that non-local dispersal shapes the genetic make-up of the crab. #> 127                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Telemetry receivers will be located throughout the Potomac River test range from Saint George Island, MD to Nanjemoy Creek, MD to capture movement of any sturgeon tagged or available through the ACT Network.

This two-year biotelemetry study deployed a beforeafter-gradient approach to evaluate migration behavior and habitat selection of two model migratory fishes, Atlantic sturgeon Acipenser oxyrhynchus and striped bass Morone saxatilis, in the Maryland Wind Energy Area (MD WEA). The MD WEA is located in the migration corridors for both species during periods of spring, fall and winter. Detected individuals within the MD WEA originated broadly, from Maine to South Carolina. During summer, Atlantic sturgeon were rarely detected and striped bass were absent in the MD WEA, suggesting a potential window for wind turbine construction. Dynamic habitat models identified cross-shelf gradients in depth and temperature that were predictive of seasonal incidence and whether test species distributions were within MD WEA or in adjacent shelf regions.  https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.6hdr7sqx3 #> 130                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The project evaluates differences in black sea bass occurrence, movement, and physiological condition between a control region (>20 km) and regions of avoidance (500-1000 m) and noise detection (2000-4000 m) associated with construction of a meteorological tower in advance of wind farm development.

This study builds upon past Hudson River Foundation-supported research, which suggested that striped bass migration patterns, categorized as “contingent structure,” might be a useful organizing concept in understanding how striped bass seasonally utilize the Hudson River Estuary. Seasonal migrations of three contingents (river, harbor, and ocean contingents) were investigated using both manual tracking (three seasonal campaigns) and remote data-logging receiver arrays over a 18-month period (May 2010-December 2011). #> 133                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Track a representative group of 100 Potomac River striped bass over a multi-year period within the Potomac River and across major regions and tributaries of the Chesapeake and the Atlantic Coast. #> 134                      Hudson River striped bass show highly variable migration patterns, as seen through tagging studies and otolith microchemical analyses (Clark 1968; Secor 1999). Recent studies have shown resident, estuarine, and ocean migratory contingents in the Hudson River (Secor et al. 2001). These contingent behaviors play a dominant role in the exposure of these fish to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (Secor and Zlokovitz 1999). We describe a study of seasonal migrations of contaminated resident striped bass to better understand the likelihood of angler consumption of these fish. We investigated the resident contingent of Hudson River striped bass, focusing on the seasonal patterns of migration by these fish. Seasonal migrations of resident fish were measured using both manual tracking (four seasonal campaigns) and remote data-logging receiver arrays (three intercept sites) over a 12-month period (October 2004-November 2005).\\\\r\\\\rResults published in Wingate and Secor, 2007. #> 135                                                                                         To bring ecosystem considerations into the current Chesapeake Bay Program striped bass FMP will require improved understanding and benchmarks for the role of water quality and habitat in influencing striped bass production. Here, we propose to better understand the constraints on resident Chesapeake Bay striped bass production under continued and perhaps worsening conditions of thermal and hypoxic stress. A widely held, but unsubstantiated view of Chesapeake Bay striped bass is that eutrophication and related increased incidence of hypoxia during summer has reduced growth and condition, and occasionally resulted in fish kills. In this study, we will directly evaluate Coutant’s thermal niche-oxygen squeeze hypothesis in the Patuxent River estuary. We develop bioenergetic benchmarks of resident striped bass growth as habitat indicators relevant to management of striped bass and other living resources. #> 136                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      US Wind, Inc. is developing Lease area OCS-A 0490 in waters offshore of Ocean City, MD (the MarWin Project Area). In tandem with this development, UMCES TAILWINDS is undertaking a coordinated program of fishery resource and marine mammal monitoring. The program includes monitoring of (1) commercial and recreational fishery resources, with a focus on black sea bass; (2) marine mammals (cetaceans: whales, dolphins and porpoises), using a passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) array and emphasizing large whales and dolphins; and (3) near real-time detections of baleen whales.

A central issue in the management of Hudson River striped bass is how this population contributes to coastal fisheries. What factors influence coastal migrations? This study used existing telemetry receiver assets in the Hudson River, shelf waters, and other major Atlantic estuaries to examine the influence of sex, size, and spawning reach on these coastal migrations. #> 138                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The goal of our research is to investigate the offshore movement patterns and spawning habitat use of sheepshead. Specifically, we will be using a combination of acoustic telemetry tags and Pop-up Satellite Archival Tags (PSATs) to obtain information about the movement patterns and spawning locations of adult sheepshead. #> 139                                                                 Research is focused on confirming the existence of spawning populations of Atlantic sturgeon, identify unique aspects of spawning behavior and population demographics within NC rivers, estimate passage success rates of adults at the LD-1 fishway located within the Cape Fear River, and quantify juvenile (age-1) recruitment to establish methods to support an index of abundance.  The research aims to address the following specific actions within the Carolina DPS necessary to recover Atlantic sturgeon populations which were included in the most recent NOAA Recovery Outline: 1) Improve understanding of population dynamics, population distribution, abundance, trends, and structure through research, monitoring, and modeling; 2) Continue researching fish passage designs that allow Atlantic sturgeon access to historical spawning grounds currently blocked by dams; 3) Develop standardized methods to create reliable abundance indices. #> 140                                                                                                     The Saco River Estuary support several species of migratory fishes. The goal of this study is to determine the seasonal movement and habitat use of Striped Bass and Atlantic Sturgeon in the Saco River. Using acoustic telemetry, this study  established a network of passive receivers to better understand Striped Bass seasonal movements in the Saco River, and throughout their coastal migratory range. The Gulf of Maine Distinct Population Segment of Atlantic Sturgeon are listed as threatened. Atlantic Sturgeon utilize the Saco River as a feeding ground, but move among nearby rivers. Characterizing seasonal presence and connectivity of Atlantic Sturgeon among Maine Rivers, is essential to better understand dynamics of threatened populations. Fish are internally tagged with V13 or V16 acoustic tag. Receivers are located throughout the Saco River and Saco Bay and deployed from June to November. #> 141                                                           The Coastal New England project integrates powerful technologies (acoustic telemetry, environmental DNA [eDNA], and acoustics) with traditional fisheries sampling to quantify impacts of changes in local and regional water conditions on individuals, populations, and community structure. Research includes study of the impacts of forage species and environmental conditions on Atlantic cod and common terns in both New Hampshire (Isles of Shoals) and southern Maine (Casco Bay) coastal waters. Collectively, these results demonstrate the value in novel technologies in tracking shifts in biodiversity across space and time. This project’s efforts build on the known strengths of each method (eDNA, diet analyses, active acoustics, and passive acoustics) while also exploring their integration and defining scales of appropriate use. Definitions of how each method describes marine biodiversity in both unique but also shared ways are explored. #> 142                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <NA> #> 143     Study to determine adult Blueback Herring habitat use, movements, rates of movement, factors influencing these (environmental, biological) movements, for both upstream and downstream migration, based on fish captured and tagged near the river mouth.  A total of 32 VR2 receivers were deployed in March 2021 from the Holyoke Dam (rkm 139) to near the river mouth (rkm 5) in the main stem, with many rx sites in coves and tributaries where adult population assessment work has been ongoing by USFWS. Fish were captured in short set drift gill nets near the mouth and surgically implanted with V7 tags that were programmed for 45 days on, then off 300 days, when trigger back on, for second year return data (2022).  Tagged fish were single sutured and released often with an equal number of untagged fish from mid April through late May 2021.  A total of 155 fish were tagged and released at rates up to 12 fish in a single day. Receivers will be redeployed in March 2022 for the n=100 \"2 yr\" tags. #> 144                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Study focuses on the Delaware River, but the acoustic portion will also tell us about the role of Delaware Bay in shad migrations, particularly whether and to what extent the Bay serves as a staging area for shad that are continuing to migrate up the coast #> 145                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <NA> #> 146                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Non-native Blue Catfish (Ictalurus furcatus) were intentionally introduced into the James River in the 1970’s to create a recreational fishery. This has led to increasing abundance and spatial distribution of Blue Catfish within the James River watershed and has prompted concern over the impacts of Blue Catfish on native species. The James River supports an active recreational fishery and a commercial low-frequency electrofishing fishery, with the commercial zone limited to a 100-rkm section of the tidal mainstem. The purpose of this project is to identify movement and distribution patterns and assess Blue Catfish response to LFEF in an effort to inform guidance, management decisions, and angler outreach. #> 147                                 Bowfin, Amia calva, is an evolutionarily and ecologically important species native to much of eastern North America. It is a large bodied (to 700+ mm TL) generalist apex predator in many river systems. Relatively little is known about the spatial ecology of Bowfin, with only a single study published using acoustic telemetry to determine habitat use  (from Lake Ontario; Midwood et al. 2018). Northern Snakehead, native to eastern Asia, is an established, invasive species in tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and Virginia. It is morphologically and ecologically similar to Bowfin. Beyond its occurrence in the tributaries, little is known of aspects of its ecology in these rivers. This study will employ acoustic telemetry to fill in these data gaps so that habitat use, movement patterns, temperature selectivity, and environmental responses of bowfin and snakehead can be assessed and compared in a tidal freshwater habitat in the mid-Atlantic region. #> 148                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Spotted Seatrout (also known as Speckled Trout) is the focus of an important recreational fishery in the southeastern United States. Management of speckled trout has also been marred by cold-stun events which can kill a significant portion of the stock and have detrimental localized effects. Virginia is the northern extent of speckled trout populations and is the most likely portion of its range to experience cold-stun events. The primary objective of this project was to use acoustic telemetry fitted with internal temperature loggers to better understand how speckled trout react to declining water temperatures and begin to assess what proportion of the population is subject to cold stun events. #> 149                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The primary research goal of this reporting period was to acoustically tag subadult sturgeons.

Both of these goals relate directly to two project objectives: Assess Critical Nursery Habitats and Assess Degree of Dependence of James River and York Atlantic Sturgeon on Chesapeake Bay Habitats. \\\\r\\\\rMaintenance of 2 receivers has continued, but the major array has been pulled since 2020. #> 150                                                                                           With changing climate conditions, stock health concerns, and increasing fishing pressure on many different species in Virginia’s waters, The VMRC has begun an effort to increase our understanding of the movement patterns of particularly valuable species both in the Chesapeake Bay and beyond. The initial goal of this project is to acoustically tag and monitor adult cobia and striped bass, with the potential to move into more data-poor species, such as red and black drum. This project was made possible by a grant from the Office of the Virginia Secretary of Natural and Historic Resources and was initiated as a complement to the work being done to maintain an acoustic array backbone throughout the Chesapeake Bay alongside the NOAA Chesapeake Bay Office, Maryland Department of Natural Resources, University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, and the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center. #> 151                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <NA>  if (FALSE) { # List your projects (which may contain some for which you do not have read access): list_projects(\"mine\", read_access = F) }"},{"path":"https://www.obrien.page/matos/reference/list_projects_mem.html","id":null,"dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Memoised list_projects function for internal use. — list_projects_mem","title":"Memoised list_projects function for internal use. — list_projects_mem","text":"Memoised list_projects function internal use.","code":""},{"path":"https://www.obrien.page/matos/reference/list_projects_mem.html","id":"ref-usage","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Usage","title":"Memoised list_projects function for internal use. — list_projects_mem","text":"","code":"list_projects_mem(what, read_access, quiet)"},{"path":"https://www.obrien.page/matos/reference/list_projects_mem.html","id":"arguments","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Arguments","title":"Memoised list_projects function for internal use. — list_projects_mem","text":"list projects want returned: projects (\"\", default) projects (\"mine\")? read_access listing projects, want list projects file-read permission?
