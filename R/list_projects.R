#' List MATOS projects
#'
#' By default, this function scrapes the table found at \url{https://matos.asascience.com/project}.
#' This table provides not only the full name of the project, but also the MATOS
#' project number and project page URL. You do not need to log in via \code{matos_login}
#' or have any permissions to view/download this table.
#'
#' @param what What list of projects do you want returned: all projects ("all",
#'      default) or your projects ("mine")?
#' @param read_access If listing your projects, do you want to only list projects
#'      for which you have file-read permission? Defaults to TRUE, though there
#'      is significant speed up if switched to FALSE.
